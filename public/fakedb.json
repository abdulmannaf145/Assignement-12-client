    "paragraph": "Short-term inpatient hospitalization may be the right choice to help your loved one in an emergency. Short-term inpatient hospitalization is best for clients who are at immediate risk of harming themselves or others or who are experiencing severe psychosis. Because the goal of short-term inpatient hospitalization is to stabilize the client, not cure him/her, staff will focus on making a diagnosis and forming a longer-term treatment plan. Staff will also administer medical care, support, and supervision during the client’s stay. The hospitalization may also include therapeutic activities to help the client stabilize."

We realize emergencies can’t wait, whether that’s a deep cut, broken bone, or medication overdose. When you come to one of the EHS emergency rooms, you’ll be seen by a caring and compassionate staff member. Depending on the severity of your emergency, we might show you into an exam room immediately or triage you with others. In all cases, however, we are generally able to see patients quickly, unlike the long waits experienced by patients at some of the large downtown hospitals."

With this technology, doctors can see your bones, muscle and more without having to make an incision. This helps them diagnose, treat and monitor a number of different medical conditions. Because the test uses a form of electromagnetic radiation, there are some risks involved in the procedure. However, the benefits far outweigh these potential risks."
